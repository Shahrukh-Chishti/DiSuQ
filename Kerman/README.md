# Graph Network SuperConducting Circuits


## shortcomings
* Graph v/s Multigraph:
- parallel josephson junctions are assumed to be linear summation in Ej
- missing on same circuit nodes with different fluxes
- allows freedom in extending the graph without including redundancies in terms of topology/value
